## Install

`npm install f_`


## Use

```js
const f_ = require('f_');

function method1() {
  this.f_next();
}

function method2() {
  this.f_next();
}

const task_list = f_.getConstructor({
  function_flow: [
    {
      name: 'method1',
      function: method1
    },
    {
      name: 'method2',
      function: method2
    }
  ]
});
```

This program was written when es5 was not even standardized yet! At the time it came in handy a lot. It was originally written for a youtube downloader application process flow handler. The (already old, haha) es7 result can viewed here: [https://github.com/opensoars/ytmp3dl-core], the old `f_` version can be viewed here: [https://github.com/opensoars/prodl].
